        "Question": "Does open access endoscopy close the door to an adequately informed patient?",
        "Sys_prompt": "---Role---\nYou are a biomedical expert tasked with evaluating the answer to the questions based on some reference answers and four criteria: **Information Recall**, **Information Precision**, **Information Repetition**, and **Readability**.\n",
        "Prompt": "You will evaluate the answer to the questions based on some reference answers and four criteria: **Information Recall**, **Information Precision**, **Information Repetition**, and **Readability**.\n\n- **Information Recall**: All the necessary information is reported.\n- **Information Precision**: No irrelevant information is reported.\n- **Information Repetition**: The answer does not repeat the same information multiple times.\n- **Readability**: The answer is easily readable and fluent.\n\nAn 1–5 scale will be used in all four criteria (1 for \"very poor\" and 5 for \"excellent\") and provide reasons.\n\nHere is the question:\nDoes open access endoscopy close the door to an adequately informed patient?\n\nHere are some reference answers:\n\n**Reference Answers:**\n['Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.']\n\nHere are the answer that need to be evaluated:\n\n**Answer:**\nOpen access endoscopy may not ensure adequate patient informed consent, as patients referred for open access endoscopy received significantly less information about the procedure and its nature compared to patients from a gastrointestinal subspecialty clinic. However, there was no significant difference in satisfaction scores for examinations performed under conscious sedation between the two groups.\n\nEvaluate answer using the four criteria listed above and provide detailed explanations for each criterion.\n\nOutput your evaluation in the following JSON format:\n{\n    \"Information Recall\": {\n        \"Score\": \"1–5\",\n        \"Explanation\": \"[Provide explanation here]\"\n    },\n    \"Information Precision\": {\n        \"Score\": \"1–5\",\n        \"Explanation\": \"[Provide explanation here]\"\n    },\n    \"Information Repetition\": {\n        \"Score\": \"1–5\",\n        \"Explanation\": \"[Provide explanation here]\"\n    },\n    \"Readability\": {\n        \"Score\": \"1–5\",\n        \"Explanation\": \"[Provide explanation here]\"\n    }\n}\n",
        "Information Recall Score": 4,
        "Information Recall Explanation": "The answer captures the key point from the reference answers—that open access endoscopy may lead to less informed patients. However, it introduces an additional detail about satisfaction scores under conscious sedation, which was not mentioned in the reference answers, making the recall slightly incomplete compared to the reference.",
        "Information Precision Score": 4,
        "Information Precision Explanation": "The answer is precise in stating that open access endoscopy may not ensure adequate informed consent, aligning with the reference. The inclusion of satisfaction scores, while relevant, slightly deviates from the focus on informed consent, but does not introduce irrelevant information.",
        "Information Repetition Score": 5,
        "Information Repetition Explanation": "The answer does not repeat any information. It succinctly presents the issue of informed consent and adds the supplementary detail about satisfaction scores without redundancy.",
        "Readability Score": 5,
        "Readability Explanation": "The answer is clear, concise, and well-structured. The sentences are fluent and easy to understand, making the information accessible."
