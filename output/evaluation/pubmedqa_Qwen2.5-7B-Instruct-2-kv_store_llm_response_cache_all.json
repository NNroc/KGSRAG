To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.']\n\nHere are the answer that need to be evaluated:\n\n**Answer:**\nMitochondria play a significant role in remodelling lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). Mitochondrial dynamics, including changes in distribution, motility, and membrane potential, are closely associated with the progression of PCD in the plant's leaves.

In patients with preoperative prostatic infiltration, prostatic resection is necessary. In this group of patients partial prostatectomy seems to be oncologically safe.']\n\nHere are the answer that need to be evaluated:\n\n**Answer:**\nPartial prostatectomy was performed after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in cases where the prostatic plane was affected by rectal cancer. However, intra-operative urethral damage occurred in 36.4% of patients who underwent partial prostatectomy, leading to a postoperative urinary fistula in 18.2% of patients.
